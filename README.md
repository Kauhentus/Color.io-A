Generate images that look like this (and the image above):

![Triangulated snowy mountain with flowers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The3DSquare/image-storage/master/triangle_flowers.png)
by converting images with custom filters in Color.io-A.

You can also generate fun color palettes like these:
![Beach Palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The3DSquare/image-storage/master/palette%205.png)
![Garden Palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The3DSquare/image-storage/master/palette%202.png)
![Renaissance Fair Palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The3DSquare/image-storage/master/palette%203.png)
![Cool Mint Palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The3DSquare/image-storage/master/palette%204.png)
with our generative palette algorithms.
So why not give Color.io-A a try?
# Commands
Color.io-A's prefix is `**`.
## **help `<page>`
`**help` contains all the information you will need to use Color.io-A. 
- `<pages>` include: `filter`, `view`, `palette`, and `gradient`. 

You can also use `**help` on its own to view all of the pages in Color.io-A's help command. Many commands have examples on their respective pages.
- Example command: `**help filter`

## **filter `<filterType>` `<resolution>` `<url>`
`**filter` allows you to apply cool filters to images.
- `<filterType>` can be either `triangulate`, `crystallize`, `pointillism`, or `pixelate`. 
- `<resolution>` determines the detail in the filtered image. `<resolution>` can be either `small`, `medium`, `large`, or `extralarge`. 
- `<url>` must be a valid PNG or JPEG image link. Images must be over 128 x 128 pixels in size. Some image URLs are glitchy and don't play nicely, so if an image URL you use doesn't work, try another one!
- Example command: `**filter triangulate small https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The3DSquare/image-storage/master/Aurora.jpg`

## **palette `<count>` `<algorithm>` `<type> (gradient exclusive)`
`**palette` generates color palettes with many different algorithms available to your liking. 
- `<count>` tells Color.io-A how many colors to put into a generated color palette. `<count>` must be greater than 0 but cannot exceed 50.
- `<algorithm>` decides how your color palette is generated. Algorithms include `pastel`, `tintedpastel`, `neon`, `tone`, `shadowlight`, `harmonic`, `triad`, and `gradient`.
- `<type> (gradient exclusive)` is a special parameter for the `gradient` algorithm only. There are preset gradient palettes as well as a random palette. Gradient types include `oceangem`, `autumn`, `summergarden`, `renaissancefair`, `beach`, `lavenderfield`, `squashpatch`, `mint`, `earth`, and `random`.
- Example command: `**palette 6 gradient renaissancefair`

## **view `<colors>`
`**view` generates a palette of colors whose hex values are given to Color.io-A.
- `<colors>` is a space-delimited sequence of hex color codes without the `#`
- Example command: `**view 9BCCC1 8E7D51 494C28 A02B3D C69847`

# More Information
- If you have issues with Color.io-A, join my Discord server and I'll hopefully shortly respond.
- Color.io-A is coded in Node.js.
- I made this bot in 4 days, so unforseen bugs (especially with the filters) may arise.
- `Config.json` 's token is empty.
- The color palettes were inspired by an earlier bot I made. However, the color palettes that bot had were simply scraped from the web. With this bot, all the colors are algorithmically generated. Also, no code was reused (you can cross reference with my repository Color.io).
